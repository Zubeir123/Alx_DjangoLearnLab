# Security Review: HTTPS & Secure Headers

## Measures Implemented
✅ Forced HTTPS via SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT  
✅ HSTS for long-term HTTPS enforcement  
✅ Secure cookies to prevent session hijacking  
✅ X-Frame-Options and XSS Filter to mitigate front-end attacks  
✅ SSL/TLS setup via Certbot and Nginx

## Validation
- Cookies show `Secure` and `HttpOnly` flags ✅
- Response headers include `X-Frame-Options`, `Strict-Transport-Security` ✅
- Forms include `{% csrf_token %}` ✅
- Manual HTTPS redirect and HTTPS-only access confirmed ✅

## Recommended Enhancements
- Add Content Security Policy (CSP) via `django-csp`
- Use third-party header checkers like [securityheaders.com](https://securityheaders.com)
- Set `Referrer-Policy` and `Permissions-Policy` headers (advanced)
